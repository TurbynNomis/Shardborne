# Shardborne
Welcome to Shardborne, a personal and evolving project where I explore the intersection of programming, storytelling, and classic roguelike game design. Here, I showcase two versions of the same idea:

The original version, a compact prototype developed when I first got into game programming.

And the new Shardborne, a fully reimagined and deeply expanded version currently in development.

# ðŸ”¹ OLD_SB â€” The Beginning
OLD_SB is a single Python file with around 520 lines of code. It was created in just a few weeks after I dove into the world of roguelike games. Inspired by the concept of starting from something random or uncertain â€” and turning it into your strength â€” I built a basic yet meaningful experience.

Though minimal in design, this early version represents my first attempt at creating something that could evolve through creativity and experimentation. Back then, I still didnâ€™t know how to merge programming with storytelling effectively. That realization pushed me to go further â€” to turn this prototype into a larger, richer project.

# ðŸ”¹ Shardborne â€” Reforged Vision
The new Shardborne is the result of everything Iâ€™ve learned over years of programming, designing, and dreaming. Now with over 1800 lines of code, the game includes:

A fully restructured combat system

Smarter enemy behavior

Procedurally generated maps using random seeds

A fragmented narrative that players piece together over multiple runs

Each session is designed to feel unique â€” a challenge to both your strategy and your curiosity. This version aims to blend classic RPG combat with my own storytelling style, bringing depth and replayability.

This project is more than a game â€” itâ€™s my personal mission to bring ideas to life through code. I hope it speaks to both players and developers alike, showing how imagination and skill can build something truly engaging.
